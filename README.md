Developer collects, uses, and stores this personal information to provide various services to its employees. Developer also transfers the information to third-party service providers, such as Hewitt Associates (the operator of the MyAccess website) and to health, welfare, and retirement plans, so that those service providers can process the information and provide services to employees.

The confidentiality and protection of your personal information are paramount to us. We are committed to safeguarding the personal information under our control, taking reasonable precautions to maintain the security and integrity of that data, and ensuring that our service providers likewise protect the data. Various security measures have been implemented, including security procedures implemented by our Information Security Group, training on data security issues, restricting access to the information only to those with a job-related need to know, and ensuring appropriate confidentiality agreements are in place to protect your personal information.

Our commitment to protecting your personal information means that we will not sell your personal information to any third party. We will not use, transfer, or disclose your personal information to anyone outside of Developer, Hewitt, and other service providers administering Developer's plans and programs unless authorized by you or as required by law, legal process, law enforcement requests, or as necessary to protect the property, interests, and rights of Developer.

This Data Privacy Statement may be updated periodically, and we encourage you to review it regularly. By doing so, you will always be aware of the information we collect, how we use it, and to whom we disclose the information. If you have any questions or concerns about Developer's use of your personally identifiable information or this Data Privacy Statement, please email [dataprivacy@developer.com](mailto:dataprivacy@developer.com).
